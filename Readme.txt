**********************************
* reh - Animals in the terminal! *
**********************************
reh is just a goofy program I wrote for fun
using ASCII art from 
http://www.ascii-art.de/
and C code. 

The animals in there are 
    skunks  just run reh!
    fox     --fox
    dog     --dog
    horse   --horse
 

It's just something made while bored.

You will need the following installed
autoconf
automake

to compile you just do the following
./configure
make
make install

Have a good day!
