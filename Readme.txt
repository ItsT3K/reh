**********************************
* reh - Animals in the terminal! *
**********************************
reh is just a goofy program I wrote for fun
using ASCII art from 
http://www.ascii-art.de/
and C++ code. 

The animals included are
    Skunk
    Dog
    Fox
    Horse
    
more will come later
 

It's just something made while bored.

You will need the following installed
autoconf
automake

to compile you just do the following
./configure
make
make install

Have a good day!
