**********************************
* reh - a skunk in your terminal *
**********************************
reh is just a goofy program I wrote for fun
using ASCII art from 
http://www.ascii-art.de/ascii/s/skunk.txt
and C code. 

It's just something made while bored.

You will need the following installed
autoconf
automake

to compile you just do the following
./configure
make
make install

Have a good day!
